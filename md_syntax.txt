# Some Markdown Syntax

## Basic Syntax

### Paragraphs & New Lines

This is the first paragraph. You can **switch to a new line without starting a new paragraph** by ending the line with two white spaces.  
This is a new line in the same paragraph.
Only switching to the new line won't work. Remember to leave two white spaces at the end of the previous line.

This is the second paragraph. You can use footnote syntax.

### Text formatting


#### Bold & Italics

Write *italic*, **bold**, and ***bold-italic*** text.


#### Code & Code Chunk

`code is written inside two backticks`.

A code chunk is specified by three backticks:

```
This is a code chunk without syntax highlighting.
```

##### Syntax Highlighting

```python
x = 1 + 1

def foo():
	print('foo is a function')
```

#### Block Quotes

  I would take him kindly and forgivingly by the hand and lead him
  to a quiet place and kill him."
